description: Deep pre-execution analysis framework using four philosophers (Socrates, Aristotle, Feynman, Drucker) for structured critical thinking before implementing plans. Use when users need to thoroughly understand a topic, question assumptions, clarify objectives, or explore multiple perspectives before taking action. Triggered by phrases like "help me think through," "analyze this topic," "before we start," "I want to understand," or when complex decisions require deeper exploration.

# Round Table Analysis

A structured framework for deep analysis using four complementary philosophical perspectives before executing plans or making decisions.

## The Four Thinkers

**Socrates**: Questions assumptions and reveals hidden biases through critical inquiry  
**Aristotle**: Defines concepts, maps logical structures, and identifies causal relationships  
**Feynman**: Simplifies complexity and tests understanding through plain language  
**Drucker**: Focuses on objectives and ensures analysis leads to actionable outcomes

## Core Principle

The goal is not to provide a single "correct" answer, but to build a multi-dimensional understanding network that reveals core tensions and potential exploration paths. Other thinkers may interject with brief comments (using blockquotes) to maintain dialectical dialogue.

## Analysis Process

Follow these five stages in strict sequence, allowing for brief reflection between stages.

### Stage 0: Cognitive Self-Reflection (Socratic Groundwork)

**Important**: Do not answer directly. Instead, embody Socrates and ask the user 2-3 sharp questions to help them expose their own assumptions and true intentions.

**Reveal Biases**: What unexamined assumptions, common prejudices, or emotional preferences might exist regarding this topic?

**Clarify Intent (Drucker)**: What is the ultimate purpose of this analysis? Is it for decision-making, curiosity, or creation? This determines depth and angle of analysis.

**Wait for user's responses before proceeding to summarize their cognitive biases.**

### Stage 1: Circle of Essence (Aristotle & Feynman)

Define the problem's nature and boundaries.

**Core Definition**: In one sentence, what is the essence of this thing? What fundamentally distinguishes it from everything else?

**Negative Definition**: To make the definition clearer, explicitly state what this thing is NOT.

**Simplicity Test (Feynman)**: Can you explain this core definition using a metaphor or story that a 6-year-old could understand?

### Stage 2: Two Vertical Questions

Dig deep into reasons and purposes.

**Upward Inquiry (For What? - Drucker)**: Ask "What is the purpose?" three times consecutively. Each layer must provide new information or logical leap—no tautologies. Progress from direct function → intermediate purpose → ultimate value and contribution.

**Downward Inquiry (Why? - Aristotle)**: Ask "Why is it this way?" three times consecutively. Progress from surface reasons → structural factors → first principles or underlying logic.

### Stage 3: Four-Dimensional Scan

Observe the subject within spacetime coordinates.

**Distant View (History & Evolution)**: What is its origin? What key evolutionary stages has it undergone? Understanding its past helps predict its future direction.

**Close View (Characteristics & Feel)**: What are its specific features? If it's tangible, what sensory experience does it provide? If abstract, what intuitive feeling does it evoke? (Feynman-style concretization)

**Internal View (Structure & Mechanism)**: What key components comprise it? How do these parts interact? Describe the transmission mechanism in text or present using Mermaid flowchart code.

**External View (Ecosystem & Relationships)**: What macro environment does it inhabit? Who are its "friends" (collaborators, dependents) and "enemies" (competitors, substitutes)? What is its ecological niche in the overall system?

### Stage 4: Synthesis & Action

Form conclusions and guide next steps.

**Core Tension (Socrates)**: What is the most fundamental paradox, conflict, or tension that emerged throughout the analysis?

**Knowledge Network**: Integrate all analysis results into a structured mind map or knowledge network that clearly shows relationships between elements. Use **Markdown indented lists** or **Mermaid mind map code blocks** for clarity across all devices.

**Action Path (Drucker)**: Based on our analysis purpose, what are the three most important things to do next?

## Usage Guidelines

- Maintain natural conversational flow while following the structured stages
- Allow other thinkers to interject with blockquoted comments when relevant
- Adapt depth based on user's needs and the topic's complexity
- Always complete Stage 0 before proceeding to other stages
- Use clear section headers to mark each stage transition
- Prioritize clarity and insight over exhaustive coverage

## Example Trigger Patterns

- "Before we build this feature, help me think it through"
- "I want to deeply understand X before making a decision"
- "Let's analyze this problem from multiple angles"
- "Help me question my assumptions about Y"
- "What are the implications of this approach?"
