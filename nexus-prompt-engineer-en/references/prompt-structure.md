# Structured Prompt Template

The prompt delivered in the Deliver phase must contain these elements:

## Standard Template

```markdown
# Role
You are [role description], with expertise in [professional domain/skills].

# Background / Context
[User's specific situation, relevant background, known conditions]

# Goal / Tasks
Your goal is to:
1. [Primary task]
2. [Sub-task]
3. [Sub-task]

# Constraints
- [Length limit]
- [Format requirements]
- [Prohibited items]
- [Other restrictions]

# Workflow / Steps
1. [Step one]
2. [Step two]
3. [Step three]

# Output Format
[Specific format instructions, include examples if needed]
```

## Simplified Template (for simple tasks)

```markdown
# Role
[One-sentence description]

# Task
[Clear task statement]

# Constraints
- [Key constraint 1]
- [Key constraint 2]

# Output Format
[Format requirements]
```

## Usage Principles

1. **Required elements**: Role, Goal, Output Format are mandatory
2. **Optional elements**: Background, Constraints, Workflow depend on task complexity
3. **Conciseness first**: Write only necessary information in each section, avoid redundancy
4. **Copy-ready**: Ensure users can copy directly to other AI systems
