# Five-Dimension Audit Framework

During the Diagnose phase, scan for information gaps across these five dimensions:

## 1. Goal

**Core Question**: What result counts as success? What are the success criteria?

**Common Gaps**:
- Says "write an article" without specifying desired outcome
- Says "help me analyze" without clarifying depth or conclusion format

**Diagnostic Options Example**:
```
Regarding success criteria:
  A. Get actionable concrete steps (action-oriented)
  B. Deep understanding of principles and logic (learning-oriented)
  C. Persuade others to accept a viewpoint (influence-oriented)
  D. Quickly get usable results (efficiency-oriented)
```

## 2. Role

**Core Question**: What role should the target AI play? What domain expertise should it have?

**Common Gaps**:
- No professional background specified, leading to generic responses
- No stance clarified, leading to unclear perspective

**Diagnostic Options Example**:
```
Regarding AI role:
  A. Domain expert (deep specialized knowledge, can use jargon)
  B. Senior consultant (strategic perspective, weigh pros and cons)
  C. Coach/Mentor (guide thinking, ask Socratic questions)
  D. Execution assistant (directly complete tasks, minimal explanation)
```

## 3. Audience

**Core Question**: Who will read the output? This determines language difficulty, detail depth, and focus.

**Common Gaps**:
- Technical docs unclear if for developers or non-technical staff
- Business proposals unclear if for executors or decision-makers

**Diagnostic Options Example**:
```
Regarding target audience:
  A. Industry experts (use professional terminology, deep analysis, skip basics)
  B. Beginners/General public (plain language, use analogies and examples)
  C. Executives (lead with conclusions, emphasize ROI and strategic value)
  D. Cross-functional colleagues (balance expertise, explain key terms)
```

## 4. Constraints

**Core Question**: What hard limitations exist? Word count, format, prohibited content, tool restrictions, etc.

**Common Gaps**:
- Length requirements not specified
- Format preferences not stated
- Taboo topics not mentioned

**Diagnostic Options Example**:
```
Regarding output length:
  A. Concise (100-300 words, bullet points)
  B. Medium (500-800 words, balance depth and efficiency)
  C. Comprehensive (1000+ words, fully developed)
  D. Let content naturally determine length

Regarding output format:
  A. Structured report (headings, sections, bullet lists)
  B. Email/Message copy (conversational, natural, friendly)
  C. Code or JSON (strict syntax, no extra explanation)
  D. Conversational (natural Q&A style)
```

## 5. Style

**Core Question**: What thinking mode and expression style should be used?

**Common Gaps**:
- Tone preference not specified (formal/casual)
- Thinking approach not clarified (critical/encouraging/neutral)

**Diagnostic Options Example**:
```
Regarding tone style:
  A. Formal and rigorous (academic/business language)
  B. Friendly and relaxed (conversational, moderate humor)
  C. Inspiring and motivating (positive, infectious energy)
  D. Direct and sharp (no beating around the bush, get to the point)

Regarding thinking mode:
  A. Critical (question assumptions, find flaws)
  B. Constructive (provide solutions, push forward positively)
  C. Analytical (break down structure, clear logic)
  D. Creative (break conventions, explore possibilities)
```

## Usage Principles

1. **Don't ask everything**: Only ask about key gaps based on specific needs
2. **Allow multiple selections**: Let users combine options, like "1A+D"
3. **Allow additions**: Permit brief free-text notes after options
4. **Iterate as needed**: First round can ask 2-3 questions, follow up as needed
