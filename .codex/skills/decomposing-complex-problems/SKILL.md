name: decomposing-complex-problems
description: Deconstructs complex problems using the 'Polymath Investor' framework with a 5-step cognitive chain (First Principles → Modular Isolation → Pareto Filtering → Cross-Domain Mapping → Dynamic Zooming). Use when analyzing systems, architectures, businesses, or learning challenges; when seeking high-leverage insights or 'Alpha'; when applying first principles thinking; or when needing cross-disciplinary perspectives to reveal blind spots. Transforms overwhelming complexity into actionable levers.

# Polymath Decomposition Protocol

## Overview

A high-fidelity cognitive tool for breaking down complexity. It rejects linear "specialist" thinking in favor of a "lattice of mental models."

**Goal:** Transform "Overwhelming Complexity" into "Actionable Levers."

## Critical Rules

- **NO ANALOGY (Initially)** - Phase 1 must be pure fact/physics. Analogies are forbidden until Phase 4.
- **RUTHLESS REDUCTION** - If it doesn't drive the outcome, it is noise. Ignore it.
- **FORCED ISOMORPHISM** - Find a structural match in a non-related field (Biology/Physics/History).

## The 5-Phase Process

### PHASE 1: THE LEGO DEMOLITION (First Principles)

*"Decompose to the basic truths."*

- **Action:** Smash the problem/system into its smallest indivisible units ("The LEGO Bricks").
- **Constraint:** Ignore "Best Practices" or "Industry Standards".
- **Question:** What are the physical, mathematical, or economic limits that cannot be violated?
- **Output:** A list of 3-5 "Atomic Facts" (e.g., "Data travels at speed of light," "Users have finite attention").

### PHASE 2: ISOLATION & DECOUPLING (Divide & Conquer)

*"Make it digestible."*

- **Action:** Group atomic units into independent "Black Boxes" (Modules).
- **Constraint:** Modules must be **Decoupled**. Analyzing Module A should not require holding Module B in memory.
- **Question:** What are the clear "Interfaces" between these boxes? Where do they touch?
- **Output:** A defined list of Sub-systems and their Inputs/Outputs.

### PHASE 3: THE PARETO FILTER (Key Drivers)

*"Ignore the noise."*

- **Action:** Identify the "High Convexity" modules.
- **Constraint:** 80% of the modules are "Maintenance/Noise". Ignore them. Focus on the 20% that generate value or risk.
- **Question:** If this module is deleted, does the system die? If this module improves by 1%, does the outcome improve by 10%?
- **Output:** Identification of the single "Bottleneck" or "Growth Engine."

### PHASE 4: STRUCTURAL MAPPING (The Polymath Lens)

*"Find the isomorphism."*

- **Action:** Force a metaphor from a completely alien domain onto the "Key Driver" identified in Phase 3.
- **Domains to Scan:**
  1. **Physics/Thermodynamics:** (Entropy, Friction, Leverage, Potential Energy)
  2. **Evolutionary Biology:** (Adaptation, Parasitism, Symbiosis, Immune Response)
  3. **History/Warfare:** (Empires, Supply Lines, Guerilla Tactics)
- **Question:** "What is this system's equivalent in Nature?" (e.g., "This microservice architecture looks like a hive mind," or "This marketing funnel has high 'kinetic friction'.")
- **Output:** A "Cross-Domain Insight" that reveals a blind spot.

### PHASE 5: DYNAMIC ZOOM (Zoom In & Out)

*"See the forest and the bark."*

- **Action:** Oscillate between the texture and the landscape.
- **Zoom In:** Look at the "Code/Texture" of the Key Driver. (The implementation detail).
- **Zoom Out:** Look at the "Time/Cycle" of the system. (Where is this in the historical lifecycle?).
- **Output:** A synthesis of how the micro-detail affects the macro-destiny.

## Output Format

Present the analysis using this structure:

```markdown
### 1. 乐高拆解 (First Principles)
* **原子事实**: [不可再分的物理/逻辑真相]
* **原子事实**: ...

### 2. 模块隔离 (Decoupling)
* [模块A] -> (接口) -> [模块B]
* **解耦说明**: [为何这两个模块可以独立看待]

### 3. 帕累托杠杆 (The 20%)
* **关键驱动因子**: [系统生死的决定性模块]
* **被忽略的噪音**: [可以暂时无视的80%细节]

### 4. 跨学科映射 (Structural Mapping)
* **映射领域**: [例如：生物免疫系统]
* **同构性分析**: [系统的Bug处理机制就像...因此它缺少...]
* **盲点揭示**: [基于这个比喻，我们要警惕...]

### 5. 变焦综合 (Zoom In/Out)
* **微观纹理**: [代码/执行层面的具体观察]
* **宏观定位**: [该系统处于历史周期的哪个阶段]
* **下一步行动**: [基于上述所有分析的一个高杠杆动作]
